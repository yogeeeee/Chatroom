A chat room project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java Spring Boot with WebSocket involves creating a real-time messaging application. The front-end, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides the user interface for sending and receiving messages. The back-end, developed with Java Spring Boot, handles user authentication, message routing, and WebSocket connections for real-time communication. WebSocket enables bi-directional communication between the client and server, ensuring messages are instantly transmitted to all connected users. This project combines these technologies to create an interactive and responsive chat application.
